# Hypothesis-Learning
This repository includes the video of hypothesis-learning driven SPM for domain growth study. 

The video shows that (1) hypothesis-learning performs analysis and derives the next measurement parameters, then transfers the measurement parameters to SPM to perform measurement. After finishing the measurement, results are analyzed and transferred to hypothesis-learning for next iteration analysis.
